# Minesweeper REST API

## Features expected:

- [x] Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
- [x] Detect when game is over
- [x] Persistence
- [ ] Time tracking
- [ ] Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
- [ ] Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
- [ ] Ability to support multiple users/accounts

## Deliverables expected
- [x] URL where the game can be accessed and played: *https://minesweeper-front.herokuapp.com/*
- [x] Code in a public Github repo *https://github.com/cnovoab/minesweeper-rails*
- [ ] README file with the decisions taken and important notes
